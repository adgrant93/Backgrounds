# Backgrounds
A simple program to auto-scale or resize backgrounds depending on the size. 

This program is still in development.

Right now the intent is to set a random background (from specified folder), and either scale it or stretch it depending on the size in relation the monitor.

i.e. Tall slim backgrounds will simply scale (they would look terrible stretched). Backgrounds that are >=70% of the monitors' width will stretch to the width of the monitor.

I may add more options/gui later but these are my personal specifications for now.
